Clicky Endgame - An Avengers Endgame themed clicking game that tests your memory.

If you click the same Avenger more than once, the game will reset and your number of losses will increment.

The goal is to get all 12 Avengers without duplicate clicks. 

(*Currently no win logic - but if you've hit 12 you've won the game!)
